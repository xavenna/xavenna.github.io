 <h1>Cipherlang</h1>
 <p>Cipherlang is a scripting language for applying transforms to text.</p>
 <h3>Usage</h3>
 <ul>
  <li>cipherlang [-iinfile] [-ooutfile] -fmethodfile [-a(comma-delimited argument list)]</li>
   Uses a local cipherlang script to transform. Arguments are required for some transforms. If -i is omitted, input is read from stdin, likewise with -o and stdout.
  <li>cipherlang -h</li>
   Displays usage information
  <li>cipherlang -d -fmethodfile</li>
   Compiles method, adds method file to dictionary.
 </ul>

 <h3>Language</h3>
 <p>The cipherlang language is fairly simple. There exist five types of statements: var,
  const, write, load, apply.
  <ul>
    <li>var identifier</li>
    <li>const identifier value</li>
    <li>write source to destination</li>
    <li>load destination to source</li>
    <li>apply transform&lt;argument list&gt; to variable</li>
  </ul>
  Additionally, there exist operations: an operation phrase replaces a source in a write or load statement.<br />
  The syntax of an operation phrase is: variable $operation_name variable2. Operations can
  be nested to an arbitrary depth.
 </p>
 <br /><h3>Dictionary</h3>
 <p>Compiled method files can be stored in a global directory, located by default at ~/.ciplang/methods/</p>

 <br /><h3>Compilation</h3>
 <p>Before interpretation, cipherlang scripts are compiled to a bytecode format, known as a method.
 This method can either be stored in the dictionary or immediately interpreted. A copy of the method is cached locally for future use.
 </p>

 <br /><h3>More Details</h3>
 The repository can be found <a href="https://github.com/xavenna/cipherlang">here</a><br />

 Cipherlang was created by xavenna. It isn't complete yet, but a functional subset of the
 language has been implemented<br />
